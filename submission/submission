## Problem 1

**Problem**: The tags are broken up into individual characters on the post view page.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

Question: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

Answer: The underlying issue causing the tags to break up into individual characters on the post view page is likely due to incorrect handling of the tags data format. This issue often arises when the tags are mistakenly treated as a string instead of an array of strings. When tags are stored or retrieved as a single concatenated string, they might be split into individual characters during rendering.

The component where this issue originates is likely the PostView.js (or similar) file. Specifically, the problem could be in the part of the code where the tags are processed and rendered. Ensure that the tags are being treated as an array and that they are being mapped correctly for display.

To fix this issue, verify that the tags are stored and retrieved as an array, and ensure the rendering logic correctly maps over this array to display each tag properly.*


## Problem 2

**Problem**: New tags  are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags", even after a page refresh.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

**Answer**: *The underlying issue causing new tags to not appear under "Popular Tags" on the home page, even after a page refresh, is typically due to the server-side caching mechanism or the way the tags are being fetched and rendered. This problem usually stems from the backend service responsible for providing the list of popular tags. Specifically, it may involve the caching configuration or the database query that retrieves the tags not being updated immediately after new tags are added.

The issue likely originates from the tags.service.js or the corresponding service file responsible for handling the fetching and updating of tag data. This file would contain the logic for retrieving tags from the database and may include caching mechanisms that need to be invalidated or refreshed when new tags are added.Problem: New tags are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags", even after a page refresh.

This file would contain the logic for retrieving tags from the database and may include caching mechanisms that need to be invalidated or refreshed when new tags are added.

To address this issue, you should:

Check the caching logic in the service file and ensure it is properly invalidated when new tags are added.
Verify that the database query responsible for fetching popular tags is correctly updated to reflect new additions.
Ensure that the front-end component responsible for displaying the tags (PopularTags.js or similar) correctly fetches the updated list of tags after new tags are added.
By investigating and correcting these aspects in the relevant service and component files, the new tags should appear under "Popular Tags" as expected.
